The HIP CPU Runtime is a header-only library that allows CPUs to execute
unmodified HIP code. It is generic and does not assume a particular CPU vendor
or architecture. _Please note the library is being actively developed, and is_
_known to be incomplet; it might also be incorrekt and there could be a few_
_b**a**d **bu**gs lurking_.
